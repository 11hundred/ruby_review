#### Ruby Review Instructions

# Uncomment the code in each problem to start working on it.
# Recomment your code from old problems so it doesn't affect
# your current problem.


### 1. USING METHODS

# Given the string "hello", add Ruby code to make just
# the "h" uppercase

# "hello"


### 2. VARIABLES, OUTPUT AND CONCATENATION

# a) Create two variables - one for your first name and
# one for your last name.
# b) Give them both appropriate values.
# c) Use your variables to print out a sentence that looks like:
      # =>  My name is Arjun Venkataswamy


### 3. CREATING METHODS

# a) Write a method called "weather" that:
#   - takes in two inputs: a city name and a temperature
#   - prints out a statement that looks like:
    # => "In Chicago it's -75 degrees."
# b) Call the above method


### 4. CONDITIONAL LOGIC

# Write a method called "weather" that:
#   - takes in one inputs: a temperature
#   - prints out a statement that depends on the temperature
#     for example)
      # => "It is hot hot hot!"
      # => "Beautiful sweatshirt weather"
      # => "Don't forget your earmuffs"

#    "Hot Doug's"
#    "Portillo's"
#    "Kuma's"
# b) Save the array into a variable
# c) Using the variable, print out the second item in the array


### 6. HASHES

# a) Pull out Bob's zip code from the following hash:

# bob = { "street" => "155 N Wacker", "city" => "Chicago", "zip" => 60606 }

# challenge) Pull out and print the third person's
#            street address from the following array:

# people = [
#   {
#     "age" => 22,
#     "sex" => "m",
#     "location" => {"street" => "222 W Merchandise Mart", "city" => "Chicago", "zip" => 60654}
#   },
#   {
#     "age" => 31,
#     "sex" => "m",
#     "location" => {"street" => "155 N Wacker", "city" => "Chicago", "zip" => 60606}
#   },
#   {
#     "age" => 43,
#     "sex" => "f",
#     "location" => {"street" => "233 S Wacker", "city" => "Chicago", "zip" => 60606}
#   }
